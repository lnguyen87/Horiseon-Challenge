# <Horiseon Search Engine Optimization>
## Description
- What was your motivation? To create a website that meets accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.
- Why did you build this project? To test my ability to refactor code to meet the needs of the customer. 
- What problem does it solve? I was able to make the HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and position. I was able to consolidate and organize the CDD to follow semantic structure. 
- What did you learn? I learned to save the file after making small changes in order to ensure the code works as intended. Making too many changes and trying to go back and correct it takes a lot longer than checking as you go.
